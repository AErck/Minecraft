## Minecraft Instance Configuration Files
These configuration files go in the top-level instance folder for your minecraft instances in curseforge. For example, if your instance or madpack was named "Frontier" in curseforge, these files would go in the folder "Frontier".

These optional files will change the client-side configuration of your Minecraft game, such as control and display settings. These settings are Adam's preffered settings.
