## Client-Side Mod Configuration Files

Add these files to the "configs" folder of your minecraft instance folder in curseforge. These files are seperate as they affect how your minecraft game will look and behave on your computer, such as control settings and display settings. The files here are Adam's preffered settings. Feel free to change them once downloaded and placed on your personal computer.
