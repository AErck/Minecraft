# White Sparrow

White Sparrow (OptiFine) is a custom Minecraft ModPack created by me. We wanted to preserve the Vanilla experience but add useful utilities and add quality-of-life improvements. 

### Preparing Twitch
1. Install the [Twitch Desktop Client](https://www.twitch.tv/download) and open it.
2. Click the `Mods` tab along the top of the Twitch client.
3. Install Minecraft by clicking on the grayed-out picture of Minecraft, follow instructions if prompted.
4. Click on `Minecraft`.
5. Click `Create Custom Profile`.
    - Profile Name: `WhiteSparrow` (in a later step, you need this name, exactly as it appears)
    - Version: `1.14.4`
    - Modloader: `forge-28.1.56`
    - Click `Create`
