# SmartBirds.us Minecraft Server Information

Welcome to the information page for the SmartBirds *Java Edition* Minecraft Server Host.

Here, you'll find information about the servers we host, as well as access instructions, how to configure your personal computer, and community guidelines.

## What Minecraft servers do we host?

We offer two servers, one is vanilla with no server-side mods, and one with a custom mod pack.
- Vanilla: `Forever Vanilla 21`
- Custom Mod Pack: `White Sparrow`

**Note:** Even when playing vanilla Minecraft, you always have the option of using client-side mods. *Client-side mods* are mods that do not affect the server's gameplay and are typically quality of life improvements such as maps, tooltips, and mouse/keyboard modifications.

**Tip:** When you play with NO mods, you can use the Minecraft launcher or the Twitch launcher. If you will, at some point, be playing with mods, you might as well use the Twitch launcher for both modded and mod-free play so that you are always using Twitch to play Minecraft. Therefore, these instructions will only cover the use of the Twitch launcher.

Before we get started with the tech stuff, take a moment to review our [community guidelines](community-guidelines.md).
