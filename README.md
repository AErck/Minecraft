# Installing *Minecraft Java Edition White Sparrow (OptiFine)* on your Personal Computer

White Sparrow (OptiFine) is a custom Minecraft ModPack created by me. We wanted to preserve the Vanilla experience but add useful utilities and add quality-of-life improvements. 

You'll need to download the ModPack files and to configure the Twitch Desktop Client to play on our server. Contact us for server connection information.

### Preparing Twitch
1. Install the [Twitch Desktop Client](https://www.twitch.tv/download) and open it.
2. Click the `Mods` tab along the top of the Twitch client.
3. Install Minecraft by clicking on the grayed-out picture of Minecraft, follow instructions if prompted.
4. Click on `Minecraft`.
5. Click `Create Custom Profile`.
  1. Profile Name: `WhiteSparrow` (in a later step, you need this name, exactly as it appears)
  2. Version: `1.14.4`
  3. Modloader: `forge-28.1.56`
  4. Click `Create`


### Downloading Minecraft White Sparrow (OptiFine)

1. Download the folder `WhiteSparrow(OptiFine)-1.1` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_Sm5tEGQjehlb9z48dejWJCA9cMacwZr). If you have trouble downloading the regular (non-zipped) folder, you can try the zipped folder - just remember to extract the contents.
2. Save/move the `WhiteSparrow(OptiFine)-1.1` folder to Twitch's Minecraft Instances folder. On my system (Twitch's default location), I navigate to `C:\Users\WendiS\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances\WhiteSparrow`.
3. If prompted to overwrite or skip files, choose `Overwrite`.


### Ready to Play
1. Go back to the Twitch client, return to the Minecraft page `MyModpacks`, click on the `WhiteSparrow` Modpack, and refresh the page by clicking `Refresh` just above the image. 
2. You should see a list of `Installed Mods` populate beneath the image. If you would like to know what each Mod does, you can click on the Mod name to read the details. Some developers are better than others explaining their Mods.
3. Click `Play` in the Twitch window and follow any additional installation instructions and sign-in requirements as needed.
4. After the launcher has loaded, click `PLAY` and wait for the game and mods to load.
5. Then click `Multiplayer`, then click `Add Server`.
6. For server information, view the pinned message in our discord server or contact us.
