# Installing *Minecraft Jave Edition White Sparrow (OptiFine)* on your personal computer

White Sparrow (OptiFine) is a custom Minecraft ModPack created by me. You'll need to download the ModPack files and to configure the Twitch Desktop Client to play on our server. Contact us for server connection information.

### Preparing Twitch
1. Install the [Twitch Desktop Client](https://www.twitch.tv/download) and open it.
2. Click the `Mods` tab along the top of the Twitch client.
3. Install Minecraft - **need deets**
4. Click on `Minecraft`.
5. Click `Create Custom Profile`.
  1. Profile Name: `WhiteSparrow` (in a later step, you need this name, exactly as it appears)
  2. Version: `1.14.4`
  3. Modloader: `forge-28.1.56`
  4. Click `Create`


### Downloading Minecraft White Sparrow (OptiFine)

1. Download the folder `WhiteSparrow(OptiFine)-1.1` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rWorM8NL5D1MsGTfbzOpK-9HPl9ESGsP?usp=sharing). If you have trouble downloading the regular (non-zipped) folder, you can try the zipped folder - ust remember to extract the contents.
2. Save/move the `WhiteSparrow(OptiFine)-1.1` folder to Twitch's Minecraft Instances folder. On my system (Twitch's default location), I navigate to `C:\Users\WendiS\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances\WhiteSparrow`.
3. If prompted to overwrite or skip files, choose `Overwrite`.
