# SmartBirds.us Minecraft Server Information

Welcome to the information page for the SmartBirds Minecraft Server Host.

Here, you'll find information about the servers we host, as well as access instructions, how to configure your personal computer, and community guidelines.

## What Minecraft servers do we host?

We offer two servers, one is vanilla with no server-side mods, and one with a custom mod pack.
- Vanilla: `Forever Vanilla 21`
- Custom Mod Pack: `White Sparrow`

**Note:** Even when playing "vanilla" Minecraft, you always have the option of using client-side mods. *Client-side mods* are mods that do not affect the server's gameplay and are typically quality of life improvements such as maps, tooltips, and mouse/keyboard modifications.

**Tip:** When you play with NO mods, you can use the Minecraft launcher or the Twitch launcher. If you will, at some point, be playing with mods, you might as well use the Twitch launcher for both modded and mod-free play so that you are always using Twitch to play Minecraft. Therefore, these instructions will only cover the use of the Twitch launcher.

Before we get started with the tech stuff, take a moment to review our [community guidelines](community-guidelines.md).

Now you're ready to configure your computer to play with SmartBirds.us!

### Downloading Minecraft White Sparrow (OptiFine)

1. Download the folder `WhiteSparrow(OptiFine)-1.1` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_Sm5tEGQjehlb9z48dejWJCA9cMacwZr). If you have trouble downloading the regular (non-zipped) folder, you can try the zipped folder - just remember to extract the contents.
2. Save/move the `WhiteSparrow(OptiFine)-1.1` folder to Twitch's Minecraft Instances folder. On my system (Twitch's default location), I navigate to `C:\Users\WendiS\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances\WhiteSparrow`.
3. If prompted to overwrite or skip files, choose `Overwrite`.


### Ready to Play
1. Go back to the Twitch client, return to the Minecraft page `MyModpacks`, click on the `WhiteSparrow` Modpack, and refresh the page by clicking `Refresh` just above the image. 
2. You should see a list of `Installed Mods` populate beneath the image. If you would like to know what each Mod does, you can click on the Mod name to read the details. Some developers are better than others explaining their Mods.
3. Click `Play` in the Twitch window and follow any additional installation instructions and sign-in requirements as needed.
4. After the launcher has loaded, click `PLAY` and wait for the game and mods to load.
5. Then click `Multiplayer`, then click `Add Server`.
6. For server information, view the pinned message in our discord server or contact us.
