## Creating the Server
0. Before you start, launch your game first locally to make sure there are no errors and to generate the necessary files.
1. Export Profile. Remove client-side mods first by unchecking the boxes.
2. Save in logical location - you need to know where.
3. Go to your modpack's profile page in the Twitch Launcher.
4. Click the settings button (gear) in the upper right corner.
5. Choose open folder.
6. Copy all of the files and folders except for .curseclient, minecraftinstance.json, and mods/mod_list.json into a separate folder. Make sure the folder is empty and that it's somewhere that you will be able to find again later. (I've never seen this files present.)
7. Go to [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
8. Click on the Menu button and select the Minecraft version you're using.
8. Scroll until you see `Show All Versions` and click the button.
9. Find the Forge version you need (matching the Twitch Profile). Click the `Installer` to download.

**WARNING** wait for ad and click `Skip` on the top right. Dp not click on anything in the add!!

10. Click the download to install. Save it to a `temp` folder on the desktop.
11. Once installation completes, open the `temp` folder and move the files to the folder that contains your exported Twitch Profile.
Note: Before launching, consider copying existing server files (config,server properties, whitelist, options, etc.) into the new server.
12. Ready to launch! Double click the `minecraft_server.1.XX.X` file to start the server.
