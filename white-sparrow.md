# *WhiteSparrow* SmartBirds.us Minecraft Server

White Sparrow is a custom Minecraft ModPack created by SmartBirds.us. We wanted to preserve the Vanilla experience but add useful utilities and add quality-of-life improvements. 

## Preparing Twitch

### Installing Twitch and Minecraft
1. Install the [Twitch Desktop Client](https://www.twitch.tv/download) and open it.
2. Click the `Mods` tab along the top of the Twitch client.
3. Install Minecraft by clicking on the grayed-out picture of Minecraft, follow instructions if prompted.
4. Click on `Minecraft`.
5. Click `Create Custom Profile`.
    - Profile Name: `WhiteSparrow` (in a later step, you need this name, exactly as it appears)
    - Version: `1.14.4`
    - Modloader: `forge-28.1.56`
    - Click `Create`

### Building the custom modpack
**Note:** In the future this will be automated, but for now we must build the modpack ourselves.
1. After completing the previous step above, you should be looking at your new custom Minecraft profile. Now, to add modpacks, click `Get More Content` in the upper-right corner. This produces a list of mods.
2. One-by-one, go progress through the following list by typing the name of the mod in the search bar and then clicking `Install` on the correct mod.
