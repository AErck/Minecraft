# Community Guidelines
Welcome to the SmartBirds.us Minecraft Server Community Guidelines!

Our goal in creating these rules are not to control how the game is played, nor to limit how much fun you can have on our Minecraft servers. We aim to create a minimal set of rules that provide a "Free and Fair Community for All Players."

## About our Community Server

Access to this server is by invitation only at the discretion of the server owner(s). Only the server owner(s) and moderator(s) are able to whitelist players.

Do not share the server address. Although non-whitelisted players will be unable to access the server, sharing the address may make the server vulnerable to cyber attacks.

*Settings*
 - Survival Mode
 - Fire spread is disabled
 - Difficulty is set to Hard
 - Cheats are not allowed (no flying without elytra!)
 - Mob griefing is enabled


## Server Rules

### 1. Be nice to everyone.

Let's keep this friendly and fun. We have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination of any kind.

### 2. Do not add, remove, or otherwise modify any other player builds unless you have permission. 

In short, if you did not build it, do not touch it! However, we do encourage collaborative builds - be sure to communicate.

### 3. Communication should be conducted through Discord

Discord server membership is offered by invitation only. Reach out to a member of the community for an invitation.

### 4. Gameplay restrictions.

- PvP is only allowed in designated areas for minigames, battle arenas, etc.
- The use of client-side mods that provide an unfair advantage to a player is not allowed.


#### These guidelines are subject to change at any time by the moderators of SmartBirds.us with or without notification.
