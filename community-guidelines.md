# Community Guidelines
#### Welcome to the SmartBirds.us Minecraft Server Community Guidelines!

#### **First**, rest assured that there are only a few rules!

Our goal in creating these rules are not to control how the game is played, nor to limit how much fun you can have on the Minecraft servers. We aimed to create a minimal set of rules that provide a "Free and Fair Community for All Players."

### Be nice to everyone.

We are a small group of family and friends that deal with enough crap in the real world. Let's keep this friendly and fun.

### Do not add, remove, or otherwise modify any other player builds unless you have permission. 

In short, if you did not build it, do not touch it! Some complex builds represent a significant time commitment to a player. 

However, we do encourage collaborative builds - be sure to communicate.

### Communication should be conducted through Discord

Discord server membership is offered by invitation only, reach out to a memeber of the community for an invitation.

#### These guidelines are subject to change at any time by the moderators of SmartBirds.us with or without notification.
