# *Forever Vanilla 21* SmartBirds.us Minecraft Server

As mentioned on the home page, using the Twitch Minecraft launcher is a bit of overkill when it comes to playing vanilla Minecraft. However, Smartbirds.us recommends that users play with a few client-side mods. To play with mods, the Twitch Minecraft launcher is required.
